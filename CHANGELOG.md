# v0.4.0 (2022-08-07)

## Breaking Changes

**Support : capture plaintext packet as pcapng files for openssl TLS encryption.**

> **Note:**
>
> Support `Wireshark` to open directly. Do not need to setting up `Master Secrets` files.
>
> Capture `raw packet` by Traffic Control eBPF filter. Added `Master Secrets` information into pcapng
> with `Decryption Secrets Block` (DSB).

> **Warning**
>
> change `loggerFile` flag as `-l` from `-w` , because `-w` is reserved for `Wireshark`, and keep same as `-w`
> for `tcpdump`. use `ecapture -h` for help.
> change `master secrets` filename from `ecapture_masterkey_[pid].log` to `ecapture_masterkey.log`.

# v0.3.0 (2022-07-20)

## Breaking Changes

**Capture TLS master_key ,save to file. Support openssl `1.1.1.X` . `TLS 1.2` .**

Quick Guide:

- use `ecapture` to capture TLS master_key, will save master secret to `ecapture_masterkey_[pid].log`.
- use `tcpdump` to capture and save packets to `xxx.pcapng` file.
- open `xxx.pcapng` file with `wireshark`.
- Setting : `Wireshark` --> `Preferences` -->  `Protocols` --> `TLS` --> `(Pre)-Master-Secret log filename`, select `ecapture_masterkey_[pid].log`.
- Using : right click packet item, select `follow` -> `HTTP Stream` / `HTTP/2 Stream`
